   Rules of “Score”
  </h2>
  <p>
   Four dice are rolled. The default die are two six-sided, one twelve-sided, and one twenty-sided die. The goal is to make the number “20” in two or three steps using addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and/or concatenation.
  </p>
  <p>
   If a player calls out “Score!”, or clicks “SCORE” in the computer version, he or she must quickly demonstrate how to make the number “20”. Failure to do so loses the player one point; success gains a point. Clicking “SCORE” starts a countdown which currently allows 30 seconds, which is more than enough time if you already know a solution.
  </p>
  <p>
   If a player clicks “IMPOSSIBLE”, a 60-second countdown begins. If no player clicks “SCORE” during the 60 seconds, the player who clicked “IMPOSSIBLE” gains one point. If a player clicks “SCORE” during the countdown and succeeds in making “20” within 30 seconds, the player who clicked “IMPOSSIBLE” loses two points. It is possible for the player who clicked “IMPOSSIBLE” to also click “SCORE”. Making the number “20” within 30 seconds gains back one of the two points lost because the 60 second countdown was successfully interrupted.
  </p>
  <p>
   In order to gain a point by making the number “20”, a player must use a number generated by a previous computation. Numbers generated during game play are colored red.
  </p>
  <p>
   Players start out in solitaire mode. Clicking “Group A” or “Group B” puts a player in competition with any other players who made the same choice. Clicking “Player Created” allows a player to start a new group, or to join one that another player created. Players can communicate by exchanging text messages in the chat box. Players can return to solitaire play by clicking “Go Private”.
  </p>
  <p>
   Students and anyone who wants to brush up on arithmetic are encouraged to look for mistakes in the computer generated lists of solutions. Does 15-(-5)=20 look right?. What about 2+(3_(4/(2/3)))=20? They are both correct. 4/(2/3) = 4_3/2 = 12/2 = 6; 3*6 = 18; and 18+2 = 20. You have to solve the innermost equations first, methodically working your way out
  </p>
  <p>
   Players can easily change the dice and/or the goal. There is also a place to experiment. See how you can make ‘20’ with 9, 9, 9, and 9 on the right side of the browser display, or click “CALCULATE” on the left side in order to see solutions to random rolls.

   My son Alexander (a/k/a “Alex”) taught me the game of score when he was in the fifth grade. We used four dice - two six-sided, one twelve-sided, and one twenty-sided - and a one-minute hour glass. There were three ways to gain a point. One way was to be the first to call out “Score!” and then quickly show how the number “20” could be made in two or three steps using addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and/or concatenation. Another way is to call out “Impossible!” and turn over the hour glass. If the sand runs out before anyone can show a solution, you gain one point. If someone finds a solution before the time is up, that player gains a point and the player who called “Impossible!” loses two points.
  </p>
  <p>
   I was curious about how many rolls actually were impossible to solve, so I wrote a PHP program to find them. Then I wrote a real time, multi-player Websockets version in Node.js. As I added features, I started seeing erratic performance due to events occurring out of order, but that was remedied by implementing promises. The server does not store data. The browsers keep score under the hood, periodically sending names and scores to the server which in turn broadcasts the scoreboard information to all players. I quit work on it when I decided to create a Haskell version, so it hasn’t progressed past a beta version which is online at
   <a href="http://score.nodejitsu.com">
    score.nodejitsu.com
   </a>
   and available at
   <a href="http://github.com">

   I started with the chat example at
   <a href="http://github.com">

   </a>
   /wai/wai-websockets. It is Jasper Van der Jeugt ‘s websockets adapted to the warp web server. The routine work of the chat server is receiving messages from individual browsers and broadcasting them to all participants. The server also parses sign-in messages to make sure the format is correct and there are no duplicate player names. The server keeps a list of participants in a Haskell programming language container called an ‘MVar’, and replaces the list with a new, up-to-date list whenever there is a disconnect, score change, group membership change, or a new sign-in.

  <p>
   Most hosting companies cannot host a Haskell website. I experimented with four prominent cloud hosting services and found Digital Ocean to be, by far, the easiest to use. Directing
   <a href="http://schalk.net">
    schalk.net
   </a>
   to Digital Ocean was a breeze. Uploading the compiled binary of the Score application was easy. What I have is a virtual Ubuntu 14.04 box (called a “droplet”) in the cloud. I can use it to serve traditional web pages with apache or nginx, or run compiled binary applications such as Score. After uploading the Score application, I installed public and private keys and easily ssh’d into my droplet without using a passwrod. I put a text file named “score.conf” in /etc/init, along with similar files for the other three domains being served by the droplet, domains belonging to me and my two sons. My application binary is named “server” and my home directory is /root. Here is score.conf:
  </p>
  <pre><code>env PORT=3000
start on startup
chdir /root
start on runlevel [2345]
exec /root/server
</code></pre>
  <p>
   ssh logs you into /root. That is where I keep the Score binary. I entered
  </p>
  <pre><code>chmod +x server
initctl start server
</code></pre>
  <p>
   I logged out with the command “exit”, and checked
   <a href="http://schalk.net">
    schalk.net
   </a>
   in a browser. Sure enough, the application was up and running. You can judge its responsiveness for yourself. The initial latency probably results from the size of the application javascript file and jquery-ui. Once Score loads into a browser, I have found response times to be nearly instantaneous. I can generate new rolls of the dice as fast as I can click, and the display of all solutions to a roll appears almost as fast. A

   . They run on ports 3000, 3001, 3002, and 3003 respectively. Nginx runs on port 80. All nginx does is route request to small html files which redirect browsers to the appropriate applications. For example, a request for
   <a href="http://schalk.net">
    schalk.net
   </a>
   causes nginx to load the following file:
  </p>
  <pre><code>
&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;   &lt;head&gt;     &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;     &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;        window.location="[http://schalk.net:3000](http://schalk.net:3000)";     &lt;/script&gt;   &lt;/head&gt;   &lt;body&gt;   &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;

`
</code></pre>
  <p>
   I could probably use an even smaller file, but some browsers might choke without the html and body tags. There are other ways to host multiple binary applications in one droplet, but I doubt that any are faster. I keep the droplet free of haskell code, doing the editing and compiling on my home Ubuntu 14.04 box, and uploading the compiled binaries when they are ready to go public.
  </p>
  <h4 id="code">
   Code
  </h4>
  <p>
   I modified the wai-websockets chat application’s participant list to include scores and group affiliations in addition to names. Whenever the list is replaced, the server broadcasts a line of text interspersed with ‘br’ in brackets and the prefix ‘CB#$42’. The browsers intercept these messages and divert them away from the chat message section and into the scoreboard div.
  </p>
  <p>
   Message prefixes are in the format ‘XY#42’ where ‘x’ and ‘y’ are capital letters. None of these go into the chat message section. They contain data and instructions controlling the flow of the game. Websockets messages are either Javascript strings coming out of the browsers or Haskell Text coming out of the server. Browsers see the incoming messages as Strings, which they split into an array named “gameArray”, and distribute according to their prefixes. Messages usually begin with a prefix, group, and name so they can be routed to the appropriate groups, sometimes with messages about who did what. After that, there might be new dice, a list of solution, a scorebeard update, or an active player groups update.
  </p>
  <p>
   The prefix is the first item in gameArray; i.e., gameArray[0]. gameArray[1] is the name of the sender’s group, and gameArray[2] is the sender’s name. gameArray[3] is named “extra”. The content of extra and the other list items vary according to the purpose of the message. Scoreboard messages, which are prefixed by ‘CB#$42’, contain the usual group and name elements, and “extra” is a string of formatted HTML sent by the server, ready for insertion in the score board display.
  </p>
  <h5 id="initiation-stage">
   Initiation Stage
  </h5>
  <p>
   The game interface in the browsers responds to invisible Text messages transmitted by the server and received as Strings. Chat messages sent to the server are broadcast to all participating browsers which then filter them according to player groups. Game control messages prompt the server to broadcast messages, but unlike chat messages, the messages coming out of the server might not be the the unaltered message the server received. For example, messages prefixed by ‘CA#$42’ prompt the server to broadcast a random dice roll. These are screened by the browsers to make sure they are displayed only in the browsers of players belonging to the group of the sender, and ignored by other groups.
  </p>
  <p>
   A player joins the game by entering a name in a form. Here is the Javascript form code:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="Javascript">$('#join-form').submit(function () {
    $('#warnings').html('');
    var user = $('#user').val();
    playerM = user;
    groupM = "private"
    ws = createWebSocket('/');
    ws.onopen = function() {
        ws.send("CC#$42" + user);
    };
`
</code></pre>
  <p>
   Notice that “CC#42” and the player’s name are sent to the server. The server parses the message prefixed by CC#\$42 and, if the name is in the proper format and hasn’t already been taken, the server (1) replaces ServerState list of Clients contained in the state MVar with with a ServerState list which includes the new player, (2) broadcasts an announcement for placement in the chat section of participating browsers, [3] broadcasts the updated state information for placement in the scoreboard section: and (4) sends the message “CC#$42” intended only for the new player.
  </p>
  <p>
   This is the server code:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="haskell">liftIO $ modifyMVar_ state $ \s -&gt; do
    let s' = addClient client s
    WS.sendTextData conn $ T.pack "CC#$42"
    broadcast (getName client `mappend` " joined") s'
    return s'
</code></pre>
  <p>
   The message prefixed by “CB#$42” is processed in the browsers as follows:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="javascript">case "CB#$42":
    if ("private" !== sendersGroup ) {
      $("#users").html(extra);  // Refresh scoreboards.
    }
break;
</code></pre>
  <p>
   The “if” clause makes sure that players who have not joined a group are not distracted by these messages, and it ensures the privacy of private players who might not want other private players to see what they are doing. The application can be used as a chat room application with user defined rooms. The chat section can be expanded and contracted by means of a toggle button.
  </p>
  <p>
   After logging in, a player’s browser receives the message ‘CC#$42’ from the server. It prompts initialization of the game interface, as shown in the following code:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="javascript">ws.onmessage = function(event) {
    if(event.data === "CC#$42") {
        ws.send("CO#$42," + "private" + "," + playerM + "," + "placeholder");
        $("#expand").show();
        dM = -1;
        createDom();
        createOperators();
        createDropboxes();
        $('.drag').draggable({ revert: "invalid", zIndex: 2 });
        $('.dragNew').draggable({ revert: "invalid", zIndex: 2 });
        $('.drag2').draggable({ helper: "clone", revert: "invalid", zIndex: 2 });
        createDrop1();
        createDrop2();
        $("#result1").hide();
        $("#result2").hide();
        $("#result3").hide();
        $(".extra").show();
        $(".rad").show();
        $("#new").show();
        $("#experiment").show();
        $("#private").show();
        $("#publicA").show();
        $("#publicB").show();
        $("#publicNew").show();
        $("#b0").html("Solitaire mode. Click above to enable competition.")
        $("#rollA").show();
        $("#a1").show();
        $('#join-section').hide();
        $('#chat-section').show();
        $('#users-section').show();
        $("#messages").show();
        $(".dropx").hide();
        $(".drop2x").hide();
        ws.onmessage = onMessage;
        $('#join-form').remove();
        delete $('#join-form');
    } else {
        console.log("What?");
        $('#warnings').append(event.data);
        ws.close();
    }
};
</code></pre>
  <p>
   Notice that ‘ws.onmessage = onMessage’ de-references the anonymous function and re-assignes the variable ‘ws.onmessage’ to onMessage. The entire ‘join-form’ section becomes eligible for garbage collection after the final line: ‘delete $(‘#join-form’);’.
  </p>
  <p>
   When current players receive “CC#$42” prefixed messages from new sign-ins, these messages do not make it to the chat message section. They hit a dead end in the ‘onMessage’ section.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="javascript">case "CC#$42":
// Prevents new player login message from being displayed in the chat section.
break;
</code></pre>
  <h5 id="state-and-its-mvar">
   State And Its MVar
  </h5>
  <p>
   I have mentioned a ServerState list of clients and an MVar that holds the current state of the game. Here is how that game state is defined:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="haskell">type Name = Text
type Score = Int
type Group = Text
type Client = (Name, Score, Group, WS.Connection)
type ServerState = [Client]

newServerState :: ServerState
newServerState = []
</code></pre>
  <p>
   The game state is placed in an MVar as follows:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="haskell">main = do
    state &lt;- newMVar newServerState
</code></pre>
  <p>
   State is modified during game play by replacing the ServerState list of Clients in the MVar. For example, the following code increases a player’s score:
  </p>

   For a while I used monads and Microsoft’s open source functional reactive programming library Rx.js in my Javascript code. I have no argument with Douglas Crockford and other “best practices” advocates who promote encapsulation and discourage the use of global variables. But there is a time and a place for just about anything, and when I observed that some browsers were having trouble with my code, I tore it down and made it as simple and browser friendly as I could. The timer no longer depends on elaborate Rx.js code. It is a simple “setInterval” function attuned to the global variable “DS_t”. If a player clicks “SCORE” while the 60-second Impossible clock is counting down, “DS_t = 30” resets the countdown display at 30. If someone does three computations that don’t result in “20”, the clock is stopped with the instruction, “DS_t = -1”. Those who slavishly adhere to “best practices” would find fault with this code, but to me it is elegant and beautiful. I don’t have collaborators or advertisers who might inadvertently clobber “DS_t”. There is no danger. But most importantly, all browsers understand “setInterval” and global variables, and they process them quickly and efficiently. 
 <h6 id="global-variables-are-good"></h6>   
  Coders should mindlessly and robotically make sure their variables are always encapsulated when that is expected by dogmatic bosses and team members. Fortunately, I am my own boss, free to code however I please; and whenever it can lead to no problems, I set my Javascript variables free from limited contexts, exposing them directly to every function that uses them.

   . The Microsoft corporation can join the human race and do good things when it wants to. It seems to want to more and more lately, and I am very pleased. The open source movement is a tremendous breakthrough in cooperative creation and innovation, but the open source repository sites are cluttered with half-baked, abandoned projects, and untested undocumented code. Microsoft open source, which is what Reactive-Extensions is, represents the best of two worlds.

  <p>
   It is easy to start and stop the timer. For example, if a player clicks ‘SCORE’ and uses up all the dice without making the number ‘20’, there is no need to let the 30-second clock run down. ‘$(“#stop30”).triggerHandler(‘click’);’ shuts it down. Or, if a player clicks ‘IMPOSSIBLE’, starting a 60-second countdown, and another player clicks ‘SCORE’ starting a 30-second countdown, the following code takes care of the timers:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="Javascript">$('#go30').triggerHandler('click');

$("#stop0").triggerHandler('click');6
</code></pre>
  <p>
   There is undoubtedly a more elegant way to trigger the starting and stopping of the clock, but JQuery , triggerHandler, and dummy elements seem so rock solid and reliable in all browsers that I am in no hurry to experiment with less elaborate event listeners.

   The essence of the Score calculation algorythm in the module Fm is contained in the “impossibles.hs” file. Fm has much formatting code, which is a distraction when evaluating the algorythm.

   impossibles.hs computes all dice combinations which cannot be made into the number “20” in two or three stages, as required by the game. In 1.5 seconds, it finds all 104 such combinations using a list comprehension on the seven list comprehensions which cover all possible computations. The five operations are defined as follows:

   There are no rolls of the dice that can be found only by some pair of these functions, and (2,5,12,12) is the only roll that can be found by all three, but none of the other algorithms (calc, calc3, calc4, and calc5). Those four along with any one of calc2, calc6, or calc7, are sufficient to find at least one solution if a roll is solvable. A corollary is that if calc, calc2, calc3, calc4, and calc5 can’t find a solution, calc6 and calc7 won’t either. I tested this by removing calc6 and calc7 from impossibles.hs and renaming it impossibles2.hs. Like impossibles.hs, it found the 104 impossible rolls, only in 1.33 instead of 1.50 seconds. The module Fm uses the seven algorithms to find solutions to random rolls or numbers entered by Score players. It massages the output into a single line of Text with solutions separated by “br” in &lt;&gt; brackets. The browsers receive the Text as a Javascript string which, when appended to a div, displays the solutions neatly in a column.
